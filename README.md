# Interpreting-Data-Descriptive-Statistics-Python
Descriptive Statistics is a form of representation of Data where we aim to summarize, label, organize and clean up the data given in various formats, but without drawing conclusions or inferences based off on the data we are using.

Descriptive Statistics tends to best describe data (Descriptive Statistics) and then feed it into our Machine Learning model making process through usage of features and sample sets, we donâ€™t seek to infer the data ourselves (Inferential Statistics) since that is not our aim. That is before drawing conclusions from our data, we need to see how rich our data is in both quantity and quality by describing it as best as possible.
